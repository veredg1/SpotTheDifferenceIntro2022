# SpotTheDifferenceIntro2022
my semester project for my introduction to Computer Science course in Yeshiva University Stern College for Women Fall 2022. 
This project uses a module created by the professor of this course called draw.py module created by my Professor, which is a tkinter-based graphics module. 

How to use:
  run SemesterProjectVeredGottlieb.py 

  it uses the draw.py module noted above for the graphics and for the pictures, it uses all of the gif files in this repository. 


(semesterProjectTest.py was the test file to make sure it works)
